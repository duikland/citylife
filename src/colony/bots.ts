// Newcomer + Border Patrol bots. The colony has TWO LLM bots that can talk to each other:
//
//   • The newcomer bot — one per approved household, injected with a generated life history,
//     answers the patrol in character as the family lead.
//   • The Border Patrol bot — a SINGLETON "city brain" with a system prompt that lists the
//     surveyed CityPlan: zones, available plots, and their vibes. When a newcomer arrives, the
//     patrol bot reads the newcomer's introduction and ALLOCATES a fitting named plot.
//
// Replies come from the kooker inference choke point (POST /api/v1/ai/route/chat,
// OpenAI-compatible, Bearer = a citylife PAT). MockBotAdapter is the offline / CI fallback.
//
// Storytelling caps (per the cross-platform LLM-NPC paper, arXiv 2504.13928): we keep the LLM
// history to the SIX most recent turns — anything longer bloats latency and the player stops
// feeling heard. Narrator turns ("plot allocated") are show-only and never sent to the LLM.
