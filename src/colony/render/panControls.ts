// Grab-the-world pan math for the map camera. The operator left-drags to pan; instead of a fixed
// pan speed (which crawls when zoomed in and ignores how far away the grabbed point is), we anchor
// the clicked GROUND point under the cursor: on each move we slide the camera so that same world
// point stays beneath the pointer. A far grab (e.g. the shopfronts across the map) hauls the world
// toward you fast; a near grab moves it little — always 1:1 with the drag. Pure + headless so the
// behaviour is unit-testable without a renderer.
