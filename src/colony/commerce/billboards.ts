// Spec 081 P0 — ad boards at the commercial zone edge. A PURE, deterministic survey of billboard
// sites at the approaches to the high street, each facing down the strip and advertising one real
// shop (assigned by a deterministic rotation over the surveyed plots). Mirrors the district survey's
// discipline: every cell is gated through cellOk (the shared land contract), collision-checked against
// a blocked set (roads + shop footprints) so a board never lands on a road or a shopfront, and the
// whole thing is a pure function of (district, terrain, blocked, rotation) — no Date.now, no
// Math.random — so it replays identically and is node-testable. The renderer paints the canvas poster
// (adCanvas) onto each board; the async generated-image swap (P2) is runtime data, never sim state.
