# Spec 077 — The Bot House Builder

- status: proposed
- proposed-by: irwin (operator directive) + claude (architect, from the spec-077 design workflow)
- date: 2026-06-09
- depends-on: 074 (citizen avatars), 075 (voxel homes), 076 (homesteads)
- research: `docs/research/2026-06-09-bot-house-builder.md`

## Why

When a newcomer family is approved at Border Control and walks onto its homestead, the house should
not just appear. The citizen (a Hermes bot) designs and raises its own home, block by block, on its
real plot. The house becomes an authored artifact: inspectable, diffable, re-buildable, and visibly
theirs. It makes the migration spine tangible (login to border to household to wallet to a house you
designed to jobs) and gives the bot a creative, bounded task with a closed feedback loop. The houses
must read as deliberate low-poly architecture, NOT minecraft cubes.

## Mechanic

1. A newcomer is approved and assignLot gives them a free homestead parcel (existing flow).
2. Instead of an instant buildHouse, a Build House button appears on the citizen plot in the
   Homesteads panel.
3. Clicking it opens the House Builder (`/builder.html`, popup or new tab) seeded from the plot tile
   dimensions and the citizen houseSeed.
4. In the builder the citizen (human-clicking or a Playwright-driving bot) edits a 2D top-down floor
   plan (the sandcastle wall-layer pattern) — place rooms, walls, doors, windows — with a live 3D
   greedy-meshed preview.
5. On Accept the builder serialises a blueprint script and posts it back (postMessage) to the game.
6. The game validates, stores the blueprint on the citizen record, then runs the block-by-block build
   sim on the plot, deducting materials per block and reserving labour, regenerating the real
   greedy-meshed house deterministically from the stored script.

## Rules and data

- Sub-cell grid resolution N = 4 subdivisions per axis per plot cell (4x4x4 = 64 micro-blocks per
  cell). Detailed enough for thin walls, steps and recessed doors; cheap enough to greedy-mesh under
  50ms and stay under VOX_CAP 6000. N = 8 is rejected (blows the budget across five homesteads).
- Block kinds extend the existing union (floor wall window roof door bed table plus the homestead
  kinds) with micro-architecture kinds: step, beam, glassRail, water (pools), tile (patio). Each maps
  to a colour in BLOCK_COLOR and a 3-bit code in the packed occupancy grid (air = 0).
- Room kinds, exactly five: living, bedroom, garage, patio, pool. Each RoomSpec carries name, kind,
  x, y, w, d in plot-cell coordinates plus furniture hints. pool fills its floor with water and a tile
  rim; patio is roofless tile plus a low glassRail; garage is a wide door with no interior walls;
  living and bedroom are enclosed with windows and furniture.
- Deterministic from plot tile count. The blueprint is authored in abstract blueprint units and scaled
  uniformly to the plot houseZone w by d tile count at build time. Same blueprint script plus houseSeed
  plus houseZone produces identical micro-blocks always. Seed mixing uses a strong hash so citizens
  never collide. No wall-clock, no random in the builder or compiler path.

## Cost — gating and build sim

- Materials. Per-block material cost. Keep matNeighborHouse 20 as a baseline budget; the block-by-block
  sim spends a new matPerVoxel tunable per placed micro-block up to a cap, so a bigger or denser house
  costs more but bounded. The build cannot start unless materials is at least the estimated cost
  (occupied-block count times matPerVoxel, from the validator).
- Labour. Reuses the Caesar III rule already in buildHouse: requires a free labour hand to run the crew,
  reserved for the build duration.
- Block-by-block build sim. On accept the house is emitted in z-band layers over one to two seconds.
  Each frame the renderer rebuilds the merged mesh up to the current zTarget. Materials are deducted
  incrementally; if materials run out mid-build the sim pauses and the partial house stands until stock
  recovers.

## Acceptance

After a newcomer is in world (assignLot done, citizen registered), a Build House button on their plot
in the Homesteads panel opens the builder (popup or new tab,
`/builder.html?citizenId=...&lotId=...&w=...&d=...&seed=...`). The builder returns, via
postMessage of type blueprint_saved with the script, a stored blueprint script that the game validates,
persists on the citizen record, and uses to regenerate the actual greedy-meshed voxel house on that
plot (deterministically, block by block, gated on materials plus labour). Re-opening the builder loads
the stored script for further editing; reloading the game regenerates the identical house from the
stored script.

## Architecture

- Blueprint format: a compact single-line whitespace-token text DSL (not JSON) — git-diffable,
  LLM-writable in one breath, ~200 bytes, parsed to a typed ParsedBlueprint and serialised back
  losslessly. Grammar v1:
  `house{w:<int> d:<int> wallH:<int> door:<n|s|e|w>} room{kind:<living|bedroom|garage|patio|pool> x:<int> y:<int> w:<int> d:<int> win:<0|1>}...`
  Example (a 6x5 home, living plus bedroom plus patio, door south):
  `house{w:6 d:5 wallH:2 door:s} room{kind:living x:0 y:0 w:4 d:3 win:1} room{kind:bedroom x:4 y:0 w:2 d:3 win:1} room{kind:patio x:0 y:3 w:6 d:2 win:0}`
- Mesh strategy: greedy meshing, one merged BufferGeometry per house with flat per-quad normals and
  vertex colours from BLOCK_COLOR, added to the scene at a tile-local origin. This is the single change
  that kills the minecraft look while LOWERING draw calls (one mesh per house vs hundreds of instances).
- Core is a framework-agnostic module (blueprintScript.ts, houseBuilder.ts, render/voxelMesh.ts): pure
  TS, deterministic, the single source of truth imported by the game renderer, the builder UI, and the
  headless bot. The builder UI is a separate Vite route (builder.html plus routes/builderMain.tsx) — a
  thin shell over the shared core, with data-build-action selectors on every control for
  Playwright/bot driving.
- Same blueprint runs in the game and headless: compileBlueprint(script, {w,d,seed}) runs in the browser
  (game plus builder) and in a headless Node container (occupancy plus a BlueprintReport, optional
  top-down PNG). The bot loop: starter blueprint to compile to read BlueprintReport (plus optional PNG)
  to apply exactly one mutation to repeat, capped at 3 iterations, then save via the same path the human
  Accept button uses.

## Phased build plan

- P0 — Blueprint DSL plus tests (no rendering change): blueprintScript.ts (parse, serialise, validate).
- P1 — Compiler: blueprint to 4x4x4 occupancy to Block[] (back-compat with the existing instanced path).
- P2 — Greedy mesher plus merged-geometry render path (the anti-minecraft change).
- P3 — Builder route: 2D top-down editor plus live 3D preview, data-build-action hooks.
- P4 — Game wiring: Build House button plus postMessage acceptance plus blueprint storage on the citizen.
- P5 — Block-by-block build sim plus per-block material and labour gating.
- P6 — BlueprintReport plus the capped three-iteration bot self-inspection loop.
- P7 (optional) — Headless container parity (a thin Node service exposing compile/validate/report).

Each slice ships on mechanics/dev, passes typecheck plus vitest, and is visible on :5188.
