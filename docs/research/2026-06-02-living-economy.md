# The living economy — how CityLife differs from Caesar III

## The feeling we are chasing

Caesar III felt alive because the economy was **embodied**: nothing teleported. A granary sent a *cart
walker* to a market; a prefect *walked* his beat; a doctor *walked* to the houses. You watched the economy
move as little figures on the streets. Wealth, plague, crime — you could *see* them travel.

CityLife has, in two days of self-design, grown a genuinely deep Caesar-III-style economy — materials,
labour, extraction, workshops, two resource chains, four foods, power, water, services, housing tiers,
immigration, fiscal levers, trade, hazards, a calendar, a monument. But almost all of it is **invisible**:
aggregate counters that tick in a side panel. The world is a *spreadsheet wearing a beautiful island*.

The operator's instinct is right: **we have a city's economy, but not a city's life.**

## How ours is different — and better

We do not copy Caesar III's walker-only world. CityLife's island already has **both** ambient **people on
foot** AND **cars and trucks on roads**. That hybrid is the identity:

- **People on foot** carry the *human* economy — a service round, a ration drop, a clinic visit, a stroll
  to the theatre. Short, local, on the footpaths and pavements.
- **Cars and trucks** carry the *industrial* economy — a cargo run of materials from the mine to the
  workshop, of folios to the Exchange dock, of food from the skyfarm to the depot. Longer, on the road
  network, obeying lanes and the water barrier.

So where Caesar III had one kind of walker, CityLife has a **two-tier embodied logistics**: feet for
people and services, wheels for goods and bulk. The same counter that today reads `Food 320` should be a
truck pulling up to the depot and sacks coming off it; the same `Homes healthy 100%` should be a figure
walking the clinic round. **Every flow in the economy should have a body on the island.**

## The direction (what the routines should build toward)

1. **Embody the stockpiles first** — make goods *visible piles* at their buildings (see
   `docs/specs/VISUAL-STANDARD.md`), so the warehouse fills and empties on screen.
2. **Embody the flows** — when a good moves between buildings (extraction → workshop, workshop → home,
   farm → depot), run a **visible carrier**: a truck on the roads for bulk, a person on the footpaths for
   a service. Re-use the existing crew-truck and pedestrian systems.
3. **Embody the people** — tie ambient pedestrians to real life: more of them when the colony is busy and
   liveable, fewer in a brownout or a fever; they walk *between* the things they use (home → market →
   theatre), not at random.
4. **Respect the world** — feet and wheels both obey the physics: never over open water, always on the
   land and the roads. A colonist understands the shore.

## The standing rule

Every new mechanic earns its place on the island, not just in the ledger. **Prefer the spec that makes the
world more alive** — a visible good, a moving carrier, a busier street — **over one more invisible number.**
When a number must exist, give it a body. That is the difference between a city's economy and a city's life.
