# CityLife — public 24/7 deploy at citylife.kooker.co.za

CityLife runs inside the kooker kind-cluster as a static nginx SPA, served to the world at
**citylife.kooker.co.za**. Public reachability comes from a host rule in the kooker ingress
(`manifests/base/ingress/ingress.yaml`, synced by the `kooker-ingress` Argo app) behind the ngrok
wildcard. The site is **login-gated**: the bundle is a production build (`import.meta.env.DEV` is
`false`), so the local dev auth-skip can never fire on the cluster, and access requires a kooker
login plus membership of the CityLife app-users allowlist. The auth-skip is confined to the
developer's own local dev server (`localhost`, `?skipauth=1` or `VITE_LOCAL_TEST`).

## What ships

- `Dockerfile` — two stages: build the vite bundle, serve `dist/` with nginx.
- `docker/default.conf.template` — the nginx config (rendered by envsubst at container start):
  SPA history fallback, correct MIME for the three.js ES modules and asset caching, PLUS a
  `/kooker` reverse proxy to the gateway and the runtime auth/config described below.
- `.github/workflows/docker.yml` — builds and publishes the image (see "Automated publish").
- The k8s manifests live in **kooker-infra** at `manifests/base/citylife/` and the Argo app at
  `argo/applications/citylife.yaml` (ClusterIP Service, namespace `kooker`). The public host rule
  for `citylife.kooker.co.za` lives in `manifests/base/ingress/ingress.yaml`.

## No secret in the bundle

The image is built with **no `VITE_CITYLIFE_PAT`**, so no inference token is compiled into the
artifact. The colony sim, the renderer, and the cinematic broadcast loop (`?tv=1`) all run without
it. Live Border Patrol bot replies need inference auth — supplied at runtime by the nginx layer,
never by baking a token into the build (see "Runtime inference auth").

## Runtime inference auth (the proxy-injected PAT)

The served SPA reaches the choke point **without ever holding a token**:

- nginx proxies `/kooker/*` to `KOOKER_GATEWAY`, mirroring the vite dev proxy.
- On the inference route **only** (`/kooker/api/v1/ai/route/chat`), nginx injects
  `Authorization: Bearer ${CITYLIFE_PAT}` from the `CITYLIFE_PAT` env, sourced from the
  `citylife-secret` k8s Secret. The browser sends no Authorization header.
- The SPA fetches `/citylife-runtime.json` (rendered from env, **no secret**) on boot. When it
  reports `botBackend:"kooker"`, the bot adapter calls the choke point with no token and lets the
  proxy supply auth; otherwise it falls back to mock stand-in replies.

Set on the Deployment: `KOOKER_GATEWAY`, `CITYLIFE_BOT_BACKEND=kooker`, `CITYLIFE_MODEL`, and
`CITYLIFE_PAT` from the (optional) `citylife-secret`. The pod starts even before the Secret exists
(`optional: true`); real replies light up the moment it is loaded — no image or manifest change.

```
# create the PAT on the kooker-web CityLife PAT page (role: citylife), then:
kubectl create secret generic citylife-secret -n kooker --from-literal=pat='THE_PAT' \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl -n kooker rollout restart deploy/citylife
```

## Automated publish (versioned, like kooker-web)

The image publishes to **`ghcr.io/duikindiesee/citylife`**. CityLife lives in the **duikindiesee** org,
so `.github/workflows/docker.yml` reuses the same shared workflows as kooker-web and versions identically:

1. **node-version-bump** — every merge to `main` opens an auto-merging `chore/bump-X.Y.Z` PR (SemVer from
   Conventional Commits: `feat` → minor, `fix`/other → patch).
2. **build-and-push** — builds `ghcr.io/duikindiesee/citylife:<semver>` (+ `sha`, `latest`) with
   `APP_VERSION` baked in.
3. **gitops-sync** — pins that semver into `manifests/overlays/develop/citylife` in kooker-infra, so Argo
   rolls the Deployment to the exact version each release.

Same-org means the self-hosted runner and `MAVEN_PUBLISH_TOKEN` are inherited via `secrets: inherit` — no
cross-org PAT. The repo is **private**, so the Deployment pulls the image with the shared
`github-registry` imagePullSecret (the same one kooker-web uses).

### One bump at a time (no colliding duplicates)

Step 1 opens a fresh `chore/bump-X.Y.Z` PR on **every** merge to main, and those normally auto-merge
instantly. But if one gets stuck — e.g. it computes a version that collides with a tag that already
exists — the following merges stack more bump PRs behind it, and the stale ones have to be closed by
hand. That is what jammed the 0.17.0 release (0.16.0, then 0.15.1, then 0.16.0 again all piled up).

`.github/workflows/single-release-bump.yml` is a citylife-local guard: whenever a bump PR opens it
closes every **other** open bump PR, keeping only the **highest** version. So the moment a newer bump
appears the older one is auto-superseded — there is only ever one open bump, and colliding duplicates
cannot accumulate. The guard does not change how the version is computed (that lives in the shared
`node-version-bump` workflow); it only stops the pile-up. If a bump still sticks on a tag collision,
the underlying fix is in the shared workflow's version computation, not here.

## Build and deploy (manual path)

```
docker build -t ghcr.io/duikindiesee/citylife:dev .
# local kind (no registry needed): load the image straight onto the node
kind load docker-image ghcr.io/duikindiesee/citylife:dev --name kooker-cluster
# or push to GHCR (requires a token with write:packages):
docker push ghcr.io/duikindiesee/citylife:dev
```

Then let Argo sync the kooker-infra manifests, or apply directly:

```
kubectl apply -k manifests/overlays/develop/citylife
kubectl -n kooker rollout status deploy/citylife
kubectl -n kooker port-forward svc/citylife 8080:80   # local check; open http://localhost:8080 (and ?tv=1)
```

## Confirm the public host rule

```
kubectl -n kooker get svc citylife          # type ClusterIP (ingress fronts it)
grep -R citylife manifests/base/ingress     # MUST show the citylife.kooker.co.za host rule
curl -sI https://citylife.kooker.co.za      # reachable; serves the login-gated SPA
```
